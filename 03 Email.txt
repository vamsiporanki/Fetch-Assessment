Subject: Data Quality Findings and Key Insights from Analysis

Hi Team,

I’ve completed an initial review of the data and wanted to share some key observations along with a request for clarification on a few outstanding issues.

Key Data Quality Issues:
Missing Data:

CATEGORY_4 in the products dataset is 92% missing, making it unreliable for analysis.
MANUFACTURER and BRAND fields have ~27% missing values, which may impact brand-level insights.
BARCODE is 11.5% missing in transactions, potentially affecting joins with product data.
Duplicate Records:

We found 215 duplicate records in the products dataset and 171 duplicates in transactions, which need to be cleaned to ensure accurate reporting.
Inconsistent Date Entries:

Interesting Trend in the Data:
An early trend suggests that users who have been on the platform for over six months tend to scan receipts for higher-value purchases more frequently than newer users. This could be an opportunity for engagement strategies targeting newer users.

Next Steps & Request for Action:
To ensure accurate insights, I need clarification on the following:

Should we exclude transactions with invalid scan dates or assume a correction factor?
How should we handle missing brand and barcode data? Is there an external reference we can use for completion?
Would it be helpful to conduct further segmentation of user behavior by category?
Let me know how you’d like to proceed, and I’d be happy to refine the analysis accordingly.

Best,
Vamsi
